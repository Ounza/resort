                        <p>Since our modest beginnings in 2005 with a small piece of land in the Coastal locale, Canopy Height‘s development has been enlivened with the energy to offer luxury, comfort and a very fun and exciting stay. In contrast to other resorts, Canopy Heights was made with the explicit expectation to cater for team building needs and physically challenge white collar workers during their stay. We are one of the world’s most fun, rejuvenating, and reputable resorts with emphasis not just on luxury and comfort but on exciting activities as well. Since our establishment, we have expanded our international presence and today, we manage 20,000-plus rooms in more than 82 resort destinations across Africa, Asia, Europe </p>

                        <p>Our story is one of inspired thinking, which in the 2000s when the brand was conceived, revolutionised the African resort industry and incorporated a more team-building and exciting approach that was truly ahead of its time. For the resort's late founder Elizabeth Baptiste, the secret to running a business was uncomplicated and unpretentious: “We aren’t doing anything extraordinary,” the legendary Swiss hotelier was fond of saying. “We are simply successful because we are doing quite normal things in an extraordinary manner.” This marked the start of an unparalleled success story for Canopy Heights, a brand that has been synonymous with fun and team building excellence for over a decade. Lastly, we are complimented with exceptional cuisine and experienced teams to ensure perfect execution of our tailored team building packages.</p>
